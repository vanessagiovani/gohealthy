# GoHealthy

The website is deployed and could be seen at: https://vanessagiovani.github.io/gohealthy/html/index.html

GoHealthy is a health website that requires users to sign in/log in and then they can use these features: Monitor Health, Health Data, and Health Consultation. Monitor Health consists of two parts of Water Intake and Diet where Water Intake reminds the user to drink water by setting an alarm on a scheduled time and Diet observes the user's food consumption to check if it's healthy or not. Health Data menu is a page where users need to input their datas such as age, height, gender, amount of sleep, amount of exercise, and any special condition. Lastly, the Health Consultation page consists of a contact person that will be the user's consultant.
